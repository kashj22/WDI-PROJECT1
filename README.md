<h1>WDI Project 1 - Memory Game</h1>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

This was my first project whilst on the General Assembly web development bootcamp. We were required to build a game using what we had learnt so far on the course, which was an introduction to JavaScript as well as HTML & CSS. </br>
The game itself is a simple classic. There are 24 cards face down, each with a picture of a student on the GA course underneath. Each student has two cards with their picture on. </br>
When a card is clicked, that card flips over to reveal the image underneath. The user will then click on another card, which will flip over. Once both cards are flipped, the user has less than a second to see the images before they flip back. </br>.
If the images match, then both cards will fade out and the game will continue until all cards have been matched.



<h2>Technologies</h2>

This game was created entirely in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.





<h2> Responsive Design</h2>

The layout for the pages were created using foundation grid to allow for responsive design. 

<h2> Unsolved Problems</h2>

I would have liked to include a mode where two players could play to see who could solve the game quicker. We would have a timer to time each player, and the player with the quickest time would win.
